# Deep reverse image search

This is a reverse image search CLI based on the [DeepImageSearch library](https://github.com/TechyNilesh/DeepImageSearch).
It seems Python 3.12 is not yet supported, please use Python 3.11 or lower.

Usage:

```
python3 search.py --dir DIRECTORY --num [NUM_RESULTS=10] --query QUERY_IMAGE --model [MODEL_NAME=vit_base_patch16_224_in21k]
```
